# About The Terminal
* Since we are using a shared terminal (we can each see eachother typing and stuff), 
* we can only see what the person with the smallest terminal window sees 
* (e.g. if i have mine at 70px X 70px, everyone will only see that amount - everyything else will be greyed out)
* While I do not like this, the shared terminal comes with its benefits so I will keep the terminal on the bottom at a big size
* If you want to MINIMIZE/MAXIMIZE (NEVER CLOSE OUT OF THE TERMINAL) click ctr esc for mac and f6 for windows I believe
